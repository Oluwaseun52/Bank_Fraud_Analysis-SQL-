## Introduction
This project focused on analyzing fraudulent transactions in a bank using SQL to retrieve important information and evaluate the bank's effectiveness in flagging fraudulent transactions.

## Project Overview
In this project, I aimed to:
- Determine the number of transactions that occurred per transaction type.
- Identify the transaction type with the highest number of fraudulent transactions.
- Calculate the average fraudulent transaction amount.
- Find the maximum fraudulent transaction amount.
- Discover the minimum fraudulent transaction amount.
- Identify the top 10 customers with the highest amount defrauded.
- Evaluate the bank's effectiveness in flagging fraud.
- Identify the top 20 fraudsters.

## SQL Queries
The project involved writing SQL queries to extract and analyze data related to fraudulent transactions. The query file to the questions is included in the project file.

## Insight
The bank's ability to flag fraudulent transactions was quite poor. It successfully identified only 32 transactions as fraudulent, while failing to flag 16,394 transactions that were, indeed, fraudulent.

## Recommendations
In light of the project's findings, it is advisable for the bank to consider the following recommendations to improve its fraud detection and prevention measures.
- Enhance Fraud Detection Algorithms: Invest in more robust fraud detection algorithms that can better identify suspicious transactions, thereby reducing the number of undetected fraudulent cases.
- Continuous Monitoring: Implement real-time or near-real-time transaction monitoring to promptly detect and respond to fraudulent activities.
- Customer Education: Educate customers about safe online banking practices and how to recognize potential fraud. Customer awareness can contribute to early detection.
- Transaction Verification: Implement additional verification steps for high-value or unusual transactions to reduce the risk of fraudulent activities.
- Regular Training: Train bank staff and security teams to stay updated on the latest fraud trends and techniques, enabling them to adapt and respond effectively.
